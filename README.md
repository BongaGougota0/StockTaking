## StockTaking Mobile Application - Project Abandoned
App built by Bonga G., 
started in 17 November 2022 - Shelved!

## Project Abandoned 
1. Derivatives of this project exist as Bakery-Store-RE and foodways (in development June 2, 2024). Both developments are in Java. 
The only difference is, the derivatives of this project do not include a mobile application.
2. No intention to learn PHP, rather focused on building other skills (Spring, MERN stack, Java SE etc.)

## 

Languages = Java and PHP

Why this project ?
I like record keeping, an in general I enjoy running a business. With this project the intention is to create software tool that will assist a store owner to have a record 
of their daily runnings of the business. Furthermore, ideally this tool should help the business merchant to make decisions that will maximize profits. This software 
tool will also be used by the public. The data collected from the public should br usable to business owners, in such a way that they can identify consumer patterns,
needs, items that are frequently on the shopping list of consumers, most bought items and assist them to offer competitive prices.


# For businesses
