## StockTaking Mobile Application
App built by Bonga Gougota, started in 17 November 2022
Languages = Java and PHP

Why this project ?
I love record keeping, an in general I love running a business. With this project I wanted to create software tool that will assist a store owner to have a record 
of their daily runnings of the business. Furthermore, ideally this tool should help the business merchant to make decisions that will maximize profits. This software 
tool will also be used by the public. The data collected from the public should br usable to business owners, in such a way that they can identify consumer patterns,
needs, items that are frequently on the shopping list of consumers, most bought items and assist them to offer competitive prices.
